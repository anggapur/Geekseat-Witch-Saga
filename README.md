## Installing

Installation is super-simple. Grab [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) and run `composer install` in the Git repository directory.

## Explanation

The idea behind this is that reading, modifying and breaking it will teach a person how to work with MVC in PHP. The comments included in it are also helpful.

As a 3-bullet-point primer, I like to think of MVC in this way:

* **The View** - Concerned with appearance. How the application looks.
* **The Controller** - Concerned with behaviour. How the application acts and flows.
